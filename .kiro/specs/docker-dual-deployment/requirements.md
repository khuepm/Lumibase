# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Lumibase is an edge-native headless CMS currently tightly coupled to Cloudflare Workers (Hyperdrive, KV, R2). This feature introduces a Docker-based deployment option and a runtime abstraction layer so that Lumibase can run both on Cloudflare's edge infrastructure and on self-hosted Docker environments (local development, staging, production). Additionally, comprehensive documentation will guide users through both deployment paths and recommend complementary tools/services for a production-grade headless CMS.

## Glossary

- **CMS_API**: The Lumibase Hono.js API application that serves content management endpoints.
- **Abstraction_Layer**: A set of TypeScript interfaces and adapter implementations that decouple the CMS_API from specific infrastructure providers (Cloudflare vs Docker/self-hosted).
- **Docker_Compose_Stack**: A docker-compose configuration that orchestrates all services needed for local development (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, CMS_API).
- **Production_Image**: An optimized, multi-stage Docker image of the CMS_API suitable for production deployment.
- **Runtime_Adapter**: A concrete implementation of the Abstraction_Layer interfaces for a specific runtime (Cloudflare adapter or Node.js/Docker adapter).
- **Cache_Provider**: An interface abstracting key-value caching operations (backed by Cloudflare KV or Redis).
- **Storage_Provider**: An interface abstracting object/blob storage operations (backed by Cloudflare R2 or S3-compatible storage like MinIO).
- **Connection_Pool**: A database connection pooling mechanism (Hyperdrive on Cloudflare, or pg-pool/pgBouncer on Docker).
- **Deployment_Docs**: Documentation pages explaining how to deploy and operate Lumibase on each supported platform.
- **Tooling_Guide**: Documentation recommending additional services (search, queues, media processing, monitoring) for a production headless CMS.
- **Search_Provider**: An interface abstracting full-text search operations (backed by MeiliSearch in both runtimes).
- **Queue_Provider**: An interface abstracting async job queue operations (backed by BullMQ/Redis in Docker, Cloudflare Queues on edge).
- **Media_Processor**: An interface abstracting image transformation and optimization (backed by Imgproxy in Docker, Cloudflare Image Resizing on edge).
- **Observability_Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki for metrics, dashboards, and log aggregation in self-hosted deployments.
- **Backup_Service**: Automated PostgreSQL backup with scheduled pg_dump and WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Runtime Abstraction Layer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CMS to use abstract interfaces for infrastructure services, so that I can swap between Cloudflare and Docker runtimes without changing business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Abstraction_Layer SHALL define a `CacheProvider` interface with methods `get(key)`, `set(key, value, ttl?)`, and `delete(key)`.
2. THE Abstraction_Layer SHALL define a `StorageProvider` interface with methods `put(key, data, metadata?)`, `get(key)`, `delete(key)`, and `list(prefix)`.
3. THE Abstraction_Layer SHALL define a `DatabaseProvider` interface with a method `getConnection()` that returns a Drizzle ORM database instance.
4. WHEN the CMS_API starts in Cloudflare mode, THE Runtime_Adapter SHALL bind `CacheProvider` to Cloudflare KV, `StorageProvider` to Cloudflare R2, and `DatabaseProvider` to Hyperdrive.
5. WHEN the CMS_API starts in Docker mode, THE Runtime_Adapter SHALL bind `CacheProvider` to Redis, `StorageProvider` to S3-compatible storage (MinIO), and `DatabaseProvider` to a direct PostgreSQL connection string with pooling.
6. THE CMS_API SHALL select the active Runtime_Adapter based on a `LUMIBASE_RUNTIME` environment variable with values `cloudflare` or `docker`.
7. THE Abstraction_Layer SHALL reside in a shared package (`@lumibase/runtime`) consumable by all apps in the monorepo.

### Requirement 2: Docker Image for CMS API

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a production-ready Docker image for the CMS API, so that I can deploy Lumibase on any container orchestration platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Production_Image SHALL use a multi-stage build with a build stage (Node.js 20+, pnpm) and a runtime stage (Node.js 20 slim).
2. THE Production_Image SHALL include only production dependencies and compiled output in the final stage.
3. THE Production_Image SHALL expose port 3000 for the CMS_API HTTP server.

### Requirement 12: CI/CD Pipeline for Docker Builds

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated Docker image builds in CI, so that every merge to main produces a deployable container image.

#### Acceptance Criteria
