## 🎯 What is LumiBase?

LumiBase is an Edge-native Headless CMS built for high-performance multi-website deployments, resolving the scalability and CI/CD bottlenecks of traditional monolithic CMS platforms. Inspired by Directus but designed for the edge computing era.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Edge-First Architecture:** Runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers & Hyperdrive for sub-millisecond response times globally
- **True Multi-Tenancy:** Hard-coded `site_id` isolation for complete data separation
- **Page Hydration API:** Delivers layout and data in a single payload for optimal performance
- **GitOps Ready:** Export/import configurations for roles and schemas
- **Privacy-First:** Per-field encryption with AES-GCM for sensitive data
- **Developer Experience:** Type-safe SDKs, comprehensive documentation, and modern tooling
