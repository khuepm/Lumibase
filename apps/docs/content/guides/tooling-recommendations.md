# Tooling Recommendations

This guide covers the tools integrated with Lumibase and recommends alternatives for different use cases. Tools are categorized as:

- **Integrated** — Included in the Docker Compose stack, configured out of the box
- **Alternative** — Drop-in replacements with different trade-offs
- **Optional** — Complementary tools for specific needs

## Full-Text Search

### Integrated: MeiliSearch

MeiliSearch provides instant, typo-tolerant full-text search with minimal configuration.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Category | Integrated |
| Docker port | 7700 |
| Latency | < 50ms for most queries |
| Index size | Up to 100GB per index |
| Best for | Content search, autocomplete, faceted filtering |

**Configuration:**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (already included)
meilisearch:
  image: getmeili/meilisearch:v1.7
  environment:
    MEILI_MASTER_KEY: your-master-key
    MEILI_ENV: production
  ports:
    - "7700:7700"
  volumes:
    - meilidata:/meili_data
```

**Usage in Lumibase:**

Content is automatically indexed on create/update and removed on delete via the `SearchProvider` interface. The `/search` endpoint provides query access.

### Alternative: Typesense

| Feature | MeiliSearch | Typesense |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Typo tolerance | Excellent | Excellent |
| Geo search | Yes | Yes |
| Faceting | Yes | Yes |
| RAM usage | Moderate | Lower |
| Clustering | Cloud only | Built-in (HA) |
| License | MIT | GPL-3.0 |
| Managed option | MeiliSearch Cloud | Typesense Cloud |

**Docker Compose override:**

```yaml
# docker-compose.typesense.yml
services:
  typesense:
    image: typesense/typesense:0.25.2
    environment:
      TYPESENSE_API_KEY: your-api-key

- Error rate by status code
- Cache hit/miss ratio
- Queue depth and processing time
- Search query latency
- Active database connections

### Alternative: Datadog

## Caching Strategies

### Integrated: Redis

Redis serves dual duty as both cache and queue backend in the Docker stack.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Category | Integrated |
| Port | 6379 |
| Use cases | API response cache, session store, queue backend |

### Optional: CDN for Content Delivery

For production deployments, add a CDN in front of the CMS API:

| CDN | Best for | Cache invalidation |
|-----|----------|-------------------|
| Cloudflare | Global, free tier | Instant purge API |
| Fastly | Real-time purge | Instant surrogate keys |
| Bunny CDN | Cost-effective | Purge API |
| AWS CloudFront | AWS ecosystem | Invalidation API |

**Recommended pattern:**

```
Client → CDN → Lumibase CMS → Database
                    ↓
              Redis (L1 cache)
```

Set appropriate `Cache-Control` headers on content delivery endpoints:

```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=300
```

### Optional: Varnish

For high-traffic deployments needing aggressive HTTP caching:

```yaml
# docker-compose.varnish.yml
services:
  varnish:
    image: varnish:7.4
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./varnish/default.vcl:/etc/varnish/default.vcl
    depends_on:
      - cms
```
